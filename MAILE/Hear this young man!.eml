The words of the aPreacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.

 2 aVanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is bvanity.

 3 What aprofit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun?

 4 One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the aearth abideth for ever.

 5 The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose.

 6 The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to ahis circuits.

 7 All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again.
