Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced earnings for its fourth fiscal quarter (third calendar quarter) of 2013 on Monday, reporting $37.5 billion in revenue and $7.5 in profit, or $8.26 per diluted share. Apple also announced it had sold 33.8 million iPhones, a record for the September quarter (compared to 26.9 million in the same quarter a year ago), as well as $14.1 million iPads and 4.6 million Macs. 

“We’re pleased to report a strong finish to an amazing year with record fourth quarter revenue, including sales of almost 34 million iPhones,” said Apple CEO Tim Cook. "We’re excited to go into the holidays with our new iPhone 5c and iPhone 5s, iOS 7, the new iPad mini with Retina Display and the incredibly thin and light iPad Air, new MacBook Pros, the radical new Mac Pro, OS X Mavericks and the next generation iWork and iLife apps for OS X and iOS.”

Though quarterly revenue increased thanks in part to Apple's two new iPhones, it was not enough to bolster Apple's profits, as they shrank from $8.2 billion in the year-ago quarter to $7.5 billion in Q4 2013. Sales of the iPhone went up from 26.9 million in Q4 2012 to 33.8 million in Q4 2013, but the iPad was flat year-over-year (14.1 million in sales, but a decline in revenue of 13 percent) and the Mac was down in sales from 4.9 million in Q4 2012 to 4.6 million in Q4 2013.

Apple CFO Peter Oppenheimer originally provided guidance for Q4 2013 in the company’s third quarter earnings report, expecting Q4 2013 revenue to range between $34 billion and 37 billion, but the company updated its outlook in late September after the release of two new iPhone models and iOS 7, saying it expected revenue and gross margin to fall at the high end of its guidance range. Analysts’ consensus figures similarly predicted $36.1 billion in revenue with earnings per share of $7.66, while Thomson Reuters predicted $36.8 billion in revenue on earnings of $11.40 per diluted share. Those predictions from Apple, investors and analysts were only slightly above what Apple had reported in its Q4 2012 earnings, which consisted of $36 billion in sales and $8.67 earnings per share, up from $6.62 billion ($7.05 a share) in Q4 2011.
