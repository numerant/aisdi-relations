"Now let us to the blind world there beneath
Descend;" the bard began all pale of look:
"I go the first, and thou shalt follow next."

Then I his alter'd hue perceiving, thus:
"How may I speed, if thou yieldest to dread,
Who still art wont to comfort me in doubt?"

He then: "The anguish of that race below
With pity stains my cheek, which thou for fear
Mistakest.  Let us on.  Our length of way
Urges to haste."  Onward, this said, he mov'd;
And ent'ring led me with him on the bounds
Of the first circle, that surrounds th' abyss.
Here, as mine ear could note, no plaint was heard
Except of sighs, that made th' eternal air
Tremble, not caus'd by tortures, but from grief
Felt by those multitudes, many and vast,
Of men, women, and infants.  Then to me
The gentle guide: "Inquir'st thou not what spirits
Are these, which thou beholdest?  Ere thou pass
Farther, I would thou know, that these of sin
Were blameless; and if aught they merited,
It profits not, since baptism was not theirs,
The portal to thy faith.  If they before
The Gospel liv'd, they serv'd not God aright;
And among such am I. For these defects,
And for no other evil, we are lost;"

"Only so far afflicted, that we live
Desiring without hope."  So grief assail'd
My heart at hearing this, for well I knew
Suspended in that Limbo many a soul
Of mighty worth.  "O tell me, sire rever'd!
Tell me, my master!"  I began through wish
Of full assurance in that holy faith,
Which vanquishes all error; "say, did e'er
Any, or through his own or other's merit,
Come forth from thence, whom afterward was blest?"

Piercing the secret purport of my speech,
He answer'd: "I was new to that estate,
When I beheld a puissant one arrive
Amongst us, with victorious trophy crown'd.
He forth the shade of our first parent drew,
Abel his child, and Noah righteous man,
Of Moses lawgiver for faith approv'd,
Of patriarch Abraham, and David king,
Israel with his sire and with his sons,

>Who of this want, and of all else thou hast,
>Shall rid thee to the full.  Provide but thou
>That from thy temples may be soon eras'd,

>"Thou," I had said, "content'st me," when I saw

>A dame, whose sweet demeanour did express
>A mother's love, who said, "Child! why hast thou
>Dealt with us thus?  Behold thy sire and I
>Sorrowing have sought thee;" and so held her peace,
>And straight the vision fled.  A female next
>Appear'd before me, down whose visage cours'd
>Those waters, that grief forces out from one
>By deep resentment stung, who seem'd to say:
>"If thou, Pisistratus, be lord indeed

>Of adverse gods, and whence each science sparkles,
>Avenge thee of those arms, whose bold embrace
>Hath clasp'd our daughter; "and to fuel, meseem'd,
>Benign and meek, with visage undisturb'd,
>Her sovran spake: "How shall we those requite,
>Who wish us evil, if we thus condemn
>The man that loves us?"  After that I saw
>A multitude, in fury burning, slay
>With stones a stripling youth, and shout amain
>"Destroy, destroy:" and him I saw, who bow'd
>Heavy with death unto the ground, yet made
>His eyes, unfolded upward, gates to heav'n,

>Praying forgiveness of th' Almighty Sire,
>Amidst that cruel conflict, on his foes,

>Soon as my spirit, from her airy flight
