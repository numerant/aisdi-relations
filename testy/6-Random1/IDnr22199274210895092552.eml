So me to cure the fever of his pride
This man besought: my counsel to that end
He ask'd: and I was silent: for his words
Seem'd drunken: but forthwith he thus resum'd:
'From thy heart banish fear: of all offence
I hitherto absolve thee.  In return,
Teach me my purpose so to execute,
That Penestrino cumber earth no more.
Heav'n, as thou knowest, I have power to shut
And open: and the keys are therefore twain,
The which my predecessor meanly priz'd.'"

Then, yielding to the forceful arguments,
Of silence as more perilous I deem'd,
And answer'd: "Father! since thou washest me
Clear of that guilt wherein I now must fall,
Large promise with performance scant, be sure,
Shall make thee triumph in thy lofty seat."

"When I was number'd with the dead, then came
Saint Francis for me; but a cherub dark
He met, who cried: 'Wrong me not; he is mine,
And must below to join the wretched crew,
For the deceitful counsel which he gave.
E'er since I watch'd him, hov'ring at his hair,
No power can the impenitent absolve;
Nor to repent and will at once consist,
By contradiction absolute forbid.'"
Oh mis'ry! how I shook myself, when he
Seiz'd me, and cried, "Thou haply thought'st me not
A disputant in logic so exact."
To Minos down he bore me, and the judge
Twin'd eight times round his callous back the tail,
Which biting with excess of rage, he spake:
"This is a guilty soul, that in the fire
Must vanish.  Hence perdition-doom'd I rove
A prey to rankling sorrow in this garb."

When he had thus fulfill'd his words, the flame
In dolour parted, beating to and fro,
And writhing its sharp horn.  We onward went,
I and my leader, up along the rock,
Far as another arch, that overhangs
The foss, wherein the penalty is paid
Of those, who load them with committed sin.




CANTO XXVIII

>The slow and loit'ring need; that they be found
>Not wanting, when their hour of watch returns."

>So on we journey'd through the evening sky
>Gazing intent, far onward, as our eyes
>With level view could stretch against the bright
>Vespertine ray: and lo! by slow degrees
>Gath'ring, a fog made tow'rds us, dark as night.
>There was no room for 'scaping; and that mist

>Hell's dunnest gloom, or night unlustrous, dark,
>Of every planes 'reft, and pall'd in clouds,
>Did never spread before the sight a veil
>In thickness like that fog, nor to the sense
>So palpable and gross.  Ent'ring its shade,
>Mine eye endured not with unclosed lids;
>Which marking, near me drew the faithful guide,
>Offering me his shoulder for a stay.

>As the blind man behind his leader walks,
>Lest he should err, or stumble unawares
>On what might harm him, or perhaps destroy,
>I journey'd through that bitter air and foul,
>Still list'ning to my escort's warning voice,
>"Look that from me thou part not."  Straight I heard
>Voices, and each one seem'd to pray for peace,
>And for compassion, to the Lamb of God
>That taketh sins away.  Their prelude still
>Was "Agnus Dei," and through all the choir,
>One voice, one measure ran, that perfect seem'd
>The concord of their song.  "Are these I hear
