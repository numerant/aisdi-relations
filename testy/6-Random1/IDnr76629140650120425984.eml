Now seem'd the white to lead, the ruddy now;
And from her song who led, the others took
Their treasure, swift or slow.  At th' other wheel,
A band quaternion, each in purple clad,
Advanc'd with festal step, as of them one
The rest conducted, one, upon whose front
Three eyes were seen.  In rear of all this group,
Two old men I beheld, dissimilar
In raiment, but in port and gesture like,
Solid and mainly grave; of whom the one
Did show himself some favour'd counsellor
Of the great Coan, him, whom nature made
To serve the costliest creature of her tribe.
His fellow mark'd an opposite intent,
Bearing a sword, whose glitterance and keen edge,
E'en as I view'd it with the flood between,
Appall'd me.  Next four others I beheld,
Of humble seeming: and, behind them all,
One single old man, sleeping, as he came,
With a shrewd visage.  And these seven, each
Like the first troop were habited, but wore
No braid of lilies on their temples wreath'd.
Rather with roses and each vermeil flower,
A sight, but little distant, might have sworn,
That they were all on fire above their brow.

Whenas the car was o'er against me, straight.
Was heard a thund'ring, at whose voice it seem'd
The chosen multitude were stay'd; for there,
With the first ensigns, made they solemn halt.




CANTO XXX

Soon as the polar light, which never knows
Setting nor rising, nor the shadowy veil
Of other cloud than sin, fair ornament
Of the first heav'n, to duty each one there
Safely convoying, as that lower doth
The steersman to his port, stood firmly fix'd;
Forthwith the saintly tribe, who in the van
Between the Gryphon and its radiance came,
Did turn them to the car, as to their rest:
And one, as if commission'd from above,
In holy chant thrice shorted forth aloud:
"Come, spouse, from Libanus!" and all the rest
Took up the song--At the last audit so
The blest shall rise, from forth his cavern each

>Was Peter, he that with the widow gave
>To holy church his treasure.  The fifth light,
>Goodliest of all, is by such love inspired,
>That all your world craves tidings of its doom:
>Within, there is the lofty light, endow'd
>With sapience so profound, if truth be truth,
>That with a ken of such wide amplitude
>No second hath arisen.  Next behold
>That taper's radiance, to whose view was shown,
>Clearliest, the nature and the ministry
>Angelical, while yet in flesh it dwelt.
>In the other little light serenely smiles
>That pleader for the Christian temples, he
>Who did provide Augustin of his lore.
>Now, if thy mind's eye pass from light to light,
>Upon my praises following, of the eighth
>Thy thirst is next.  The saintly soul, that shows
>The world's deceitfulness, to all who hear him,
>Is, with the sight of all the good, that is,
>Blest there.  The limbs, whence it was driven, lie
>Down in Cieldauro, and from martyrdom
>And exile came it here.  Lo! further on,

>Rebuk'd the ling'ring tardiness of death.
>It is the eternal light of Sigebert,
>Who 'scap'd not envy, when of truth he argued,
>Reading in the straw-litter'd street."  Forthwith,

>To win her bridegroom's love at matin's hour,

>Sends out a tinkling sound, of note so sweet,
