Those animals, that hate the cultur'd fields,
Betwixt Corneto and Cecina's stream.

Here the brute Harpies make their nest, the same
Who from the Strophades the Trojan band
Drove with dire boding of their future woe.
Broad are their pennons, of the human form
Their neck and count'nance, arm'd with talons keen
The feet, and the huge belly fledge with wings
These sit and wail on the drear mystic wood.

The kind instructor in these words began:
"Ere farther thou proceed, know thou art now
I' th' second round, and shalt be, till thou come
Upon the horrid sand: look therefore well
Around thee, and such things thou shalt behold,
As would my speech discredit."  On all sides
I heard sad plainings breathe, and none could see
From whom they might have issu'd.  In amaze
Fast bound I stood.  He, as it seem'd, believ'd,
That I had thought so many voices came
From some amid those thickets close conceal'd,
And thus his speech resum'd: "If thou lop off
A single twig from one of those ill plants,
The thought thou hast conceiv'd shall vanish quite."

Thereat a little stretching forth my hand,
From a great wilding gather'd I a branch,
And straight the trunk exclaim'd: "Why pluck'st thou me?"

Then as the dark blood trickled down its side,
These words it added: "Wherefore tear'st me thus?
Is there no touch of mercy in thy breast?
Men once were we, that now are rooted here.
Thy hand might well have spar'd us, had we been
The souls of serpents."  As a brand yet green,
That burning at one end from the' other sends
A groaning sound, and hisses with the wind
That forces out its way, so burst at once,
Forth from the broken splinter words and blood.

I, letting fall the bough, remain'd as one
Assail'd by terror, and the sage replied:
"If he, O injur'd spirit! could have believ'd
What he hath seen but in my verse describ'd,
He never against thee had stretch'd his hand.
But I, because the thing surpass'd belief,
Prompted him to this deed, which even now
Myself I rue.  But tell me, who thou wast;
That, for this wrong to do thee some amends,

>So shalt thou many a famous spirit behold."
>Mine eyes directing, as she will'd, I saw
>A hundred little spheres, that fairer grew
>By interchange of splendour.  I remain'd,
>As one, who fearful of o'er-much presuming,
>Abates in him the keenness of desire,
>Nor dares to question, when amid those pearls,
>One largest and most lustrous onward drew,
>That it might yield contentment to my wish;
>And from within it these the sounds I heard.

>"If thou, like me, beheldst the charity
>That burns amongst us, what thy mind conceives,
>Were utter'd.  But that, ere the lofty bound
>Thou reach, expectance may not weary thee,
>I will make answer even to the thought,
>Which thou hast such respect of.  In old days,
>That mountain, at whose side Cassino rests,
>Was on its height frequented by a race
>Deceived and ill dispos'd: and I it was,
>Who thither carried first the name of Him,
>Who brought the soul-subliming truth to man.
>And such a speeding grace shone over me,
>That from their impious worship I reclaim'd
>The dwellers round about, who with the world
>Were in delusion lost.  These other flames,
>The spirits of men contemplative, were all
>Enliven'd by that warmth, whose kindly force
>Gives birth to flowers and fruits of holiness.
>Here is Macarius; Romoaldo here:
>And here my brethren, who their steps refrain'd
