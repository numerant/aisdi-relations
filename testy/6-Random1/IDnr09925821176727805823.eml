CANTO XVIII

The teacher ended, and his high discourse
Concluding, earnest in my looks inquir'd
If I appear'd content; and I, whom still
Unsated thirst to hear him urg'd, was mute,
Mute outwardly, yet inwardly I said:
"Perchance my too much questioning offends"
But he, true father, mark'd the secret wish
By diffidence restrain'd, and speaking, gave
Me boldness thus to speak: 'Master, my Sight
Gathers so lively virtue from thy beams,
That all, thy words convey, distinct is seen.
Wherefore I pray thee, father, whom this heart
Holds dearest! thou wouldst deign by proof t' unfold
That love, from which as from their source thou bring'st
All good deeds and their opposite.'"  He then:
"To what I now disclose be thy clear ken
Directed, and thou plainly shalt behold
How much those blind have err'd, who make themselves
The guides of men.  The soul, created apt
To love, moves versatile which way soe'er
Aught pleasing prompts her, soon as she is wak'd
By pleasure into act.  Of substance true
Your apprehension forms its counterfeit,
And in you the ideal shape presenting
Attracts the soul's regard.  If she, thus drawn,
incline toward it, love is that inclining,
And a new nature knit by pleasure in ye.
Then as the fire points up, and mounting seeks
His birth-place and his lasting seat, e'en thus
Enters the captive soul into desire,
Which is a spiritual motion, that ne'er rests
Before enjoyment of the thing it loves.
Enough to show thee, how the truth from those
Is hidden, who aver all love a thing
Praise-worthy in itself: although perhaps
Its substance seem still good.  Yet if the wax
Be good, it follows not th' impression must."
"What love is," I return'd, "thy words, O guide!
And my own docile mind, reveal.  Yet thence
New doubts have sprung.  For from without if love
Be offer'd to us, and the spirit knows
No other footing, tend she right or wrong,
Is no desert of hers."  He answering thus:
"What reason here discovers I have power
To show thee: that which lies beyond, expect

>Find, in thy destin'd lot, of wax so much,
>As may suffice thee to the enamel's height."
>It thus began: "If any certain news
>Of Valdimagra and the neighbour part
>Thou know'st, tell me, who once was mighty there
>They call'd me Conrad Malaspina, not
>That old one, but from him I sprang.  The love
>I bore my people is now here refin'd."

>"In your dominions," I answer'd, "ne'er was I.
>But through all Europe where do those men dwell,
>To whom their glory is not manifest?
>The fame, that honours your illustrious house,
>Proclaims the nobles and proclaims the land;
>So that he knows it who was never there.
>I swear to you, so may my upward route
>Prosper! your honour'd nation not impairs
>The value of her coffer and her sword.
>Nature and use give her such privilege,
>That while the world is twisted from his course
>By a bad head, she only walks aright,
>And has the evil way in scorn."  He then:
>"Now pass thee on: sev'n times the tired sun
>Revisits not the couch, which with four feet
>The forked Aries covers, ere that kind
>Opinion shall be nail'd into thy brain
>With stronger nails than other's speech can drive,
>If the sure course of judgment be not stay'd."

>CANTO IX

>Now the fair consort of Tithonus old,
>Arisen from her mate's beloved arms,
>Look'd palely o'er the eastern cliff: her brow,
>Lucent with jewels, glitter'd, set in sign
>Of that chill animal, who with his train
>Smites fearful nations: and where then we were,
>Two steps of her ascent the night had past,
>And now the third was closing up its wing,
>When I, who had so much of Adam with me,
>Sank down upon the grass, o'ercome with sleep,
>There where all five were seated.  In that hour,
>When near the dawn the swallow her sad lay,
>Rememb'ring haply ancient grief, renews,
>And with our minds more wand'rers from the flesh,
>And less by thought restrain'd are, as 't were, full
>Of holy divination in their dreams,
