had wrought, since thus the shout had pow'r to move thee.
In which couldst thou have understood their prayers,
The vengeance were already known to thee,
Which thou must witness ere thy mortal hour,
The sword of heav'n is not in haste to smite,
Nor yet doth linger, save unto his seeming,
Who in desire or fear doth look for it.
But elsewhere now l bid thee turn thy view;
So shalt thou many a famous spirit behold."
Mine eyes directing, as she will'd, I saw
A hundred little spheres, that fairer grew
By interchange of splendour.  I remain'd,
As one, who fearful of o'er-much presuming,
Abates in him the keenness of desire,
Nor dares to question, when amid those pearls,
One largest and most lustrous onward drew,
That it might yield contentment to my wish;
And from within it these the sounds I heard.

"If thou, like me, beheldst the charity
That burns amongst us, what thy mind conceives,
Were utter'd.  But that, ere the lofty bound
Thou reach, expectance may not weary thee,
I will make answer even to the thought,
Which thou hast such respect of.  In old days,
That mountain, at whose side Cassino rests,
Was on its height frequented by a race
Deceived and ill dispos'd: and I it was,
Who thither carried first the name of Him,
Who brought the soul-subliming truth to man.
And such a speeding grace shone over me,
That from their impious worship I reclaim'd
The dwellers round about, who with the world
Were in delusion lost.  These other flames,
The spirits of men contemplative, were all
Enliven'd by that warmth, whose kindly force
Gives birth to flowers and fruits of holiness.
Here is Macarius; Romoaldo here:
And here my brethren, who their steps refrain'd
Within the cloisters, and held firm their heart."

I answ'ring, thus; "Thy gentle words and kind,
And this the cheerful semblance, I behold
Not unobservant, beaming in ye all,
Have rais'd assurance in me, wakening it
Full-blossom'd in my bosom, as a rose
Before the sun, when the consummate flower
Has spread to utmost amplitude.  Of thee
Therefore entreat I, father! to declare
If I may gain such favour, as to gaze

>For its own flame the torch this fitting ever!
>
>No sooner to my list'ning ear had come
>The brief assurance, than I understood
>New virtue into me infus'd, and sight
>Kindled afresh, with vigour to sustain
>Excess of light, however pure.  I look'd;
>And in the likeness of a river saw
>Light flowing, from whose amber-seeming waves
>Flash'd up effulgence, as they glided on
>'Twixt banks, on either side, painted with spring,
>Incredible how fair; and, from the tide,
>There ever and anon, outstarting, flew
>Sparkles instinct with life; and in the flow'rs
>Did set them, like to rubies chas'd in gold;
>Then, as if drunk with odors, plung'd again
>Into the wondrous flood; from which, as one
>Re'enter'd, still another rose.  "The thirst
>Of knowledge high, whereby thou art inflam'd,
>To search the meaning of what here thou seest,
>The more it warms thee, pleases me the more.
>But first behooves thee of this water drink,
>Or ere that longing be allay'd."  So spake
>The day-star of mine eyes; then thus subjoin'd:
>"This stream, and these, forth issuing from its gulf,
>And diving back, a living topaz each,
>With all this laughter on its bloomy shores,
>Are but a preface, shadowy of the truth
>They emblem: not that, in themselves, the things
>Are crude; but on thy part is the defect,
>For that thy views not yet aspire so high."
>Never did babe, that had outslept his wont,
>Rush, with such eager straining, to the milk,
>As I toward the water, bending me,
>To make the better mirrors of mine eyes
>In the refining wave; and, as the eaves
>Of mine eyelids did drink of it, forthwith
>Seem'd it unto me turn'd from length to round,
>Then as a troop of maskers, when they put
>Their vizors off, look other than before,
>The counterfeited semblance thrown aside;
>So into greater jubilee were chang'd
>Those flowers and sparkles, and distinct I saw
>Before me either court of heav'n displac'd.
>
>O prime enlightener! thou who crav'st me strength
>On the high triumph of thy realm to gaze!
>Grant virtue now to utter what I kenn'd,
>    There is in heav'n a light, whose goodly shine
>Makes the Creator visible to all
