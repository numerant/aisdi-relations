Within its tabernacle, and left dark
The Spaniard and the Indian, with the Jew.
Such fables Florence in her pulpit hears,
Bandied about more frequent, than the names
Of Bindi and of Lapi in her streets.
The sheep, meanwhile, poor witless ones, return
From pasture, fed with wind: and what avails
For their excuse, they do not see their harm?
Christ said not to his first conventicle,
'Go forth and preach impostures to the world,'
But gave them truth to build on; and the sound
Was mighty on their lips; nor needed they,
Beside the gospel, other spear or shield,
To aid them in their warfare for the faith.
The preacher now provides himself with store
Of jests and gibes; and, so there be no lack
Of laughter, while he vents them, his big cowl
Distends, and he has won the meed he sought:
Could but the vulgar catch a glimpse the while
Of that dark bird which nestles in his hood,
They scarce would wait to hear the blessing said.
Which now the dotards hold in such esteem,
That every counterfeit, who spreads abroad
The hands of holy promise, finds a throng
Of credulous fools beneath.  Saint Anthony
Fattens with this his swine, and others worse
Than swine, who diet at his lazy board,
Paying with unstamp'd metal for their fare.

"But (for we far have wander'd) let us seek
The forward path again; so as the way
Be shorten'd with the time.  No mortal tongue
Nor thought of man hath ever reach'd so far,
That of these natures he might count the tribes.
What Daniel of their thousands hath reveal'd
With finite number infinite conceals.
The fountain at whose source these drink their beams,
With light supplies them in as many modes,
As there are splendours, that it shines on: each
According to the virtue it conceives,
Differing in love and sweet affection.
Look then how lofty and how huge in breadth
The' eternal might, which, broken and dispers'd
Over such countless mirrors, yet remains
Whole in itself and one, as at the first."




CANTO XXX

>The goods committed into fortune's hands,
>For which the human race keep such a coil!
>Not all the gold, that is beneath the moon,
>Or ever hath been, of these toil-worn souls
>Might purchase rest for one."  I thus rejoin'd:
>
>"My guide! of thee this also would I learn;
>This fortune, that thou speak'st of, what it is,
>Whose talons grasp the blessings of the world?"
>
>He thus: "O beings blind! what ignorance
>Besets you?  Now my judgment hear and mark.
>He, whose transcendent wisdom passes all,
>The heavens creating, gave them ruling powers
>To guide them, so that each part shines to each,
>Their light in equal distribution pour'd.
>By similar appointment he ordain'd
>Over the world's bright images to rule.
>Superintendence of a guiding hand
>And general minister, which at due time
>May change the empty vantages of life
>From race to race, from one to other's blood,
>Beyond prevention of man's wisest care:
>Wherefore one nation rises into sway,
>Another languishes, e'en as her will
>Decrees, from us conceal'd, as in the grass
>The serpent train.  Against her nought avails
>Your utmost wisdom.  She with foresight plans,
>Judges, and carries on her reign, as theirs
>The other powers divine.  Her changes know
>Nore intermission: by necessity
>She is made swift, so frequent come who claim
>Succession in her favours.  This is she,
>So execrated e'en by those, whose debt
>To her is rather praise; they wrongfully
>With blame requite her, and with evil word;
>But she is blessed, and for that recks not:
>Amidst the other primal beings glad
>Rolls on her sphere, and in her bliss exults.
>Now on our way pass we, to heavier woe
>Descending: for each star is falling now,
>That mounted at our entrance, and forbids
>Too long our tarrying."  We the circle cross'd
>To the next steep, arriving at a well,
>That boiling pours itself down to a foss
>Sluic'd from its source.  Far murkier was the wave
>Than sablest grain: and we in company
>Of the' inky waters, journeying by their side,
>Enter'd, though by a different track, beneath.
>Into a lake, the Stygian nam'd, expands
