'Thankest me much!'--'Say rather wondrously,'
And seeing this here satiate be our view."




CANTO XIX

WOE to thee, Simon Magus! woe to you,
His wretched followers! who the things of God,
Which should be wedded unto goodness, them,
Rapacious as ye are, do prostitute
For gold and silver in adultery!
Now must the trumpet sound for you, since yours
Is the third chasm.  Upon the following vault
We now had mounted, where the rock impends
Directly o'er the centre of the foss.

Wisdom Supreme! how wonderful the art,
Which thou dost manifest in heaven, in earth,
And in the evil world, how just a meed
Allotting by thy virtue unto all!

I saw the livid stone, throughout the sides
And in its bottom full of apertures,
All equal in their width, and circular each,
Nor ample less nor larger they appear'd
Than in Saint John's fair dome of me belov'd
Those fram'd to hold the pure baptismal streams,
One of the which I brake, some few years past,
To save a whelming infant; and be this
A seal to undeceive whoever doubts
The motive of my deed.  From out the mouth
Of every one, emerg'd a sinner's feet
And of the legs high upward as the calf
The rest beneath was hid.  On either foot
The soles were burning, whence the flexile joints
Glanc'd with such violent motion, as had snapt
Asunder cords or twisted withs.  As flame,
Feeding on unctuous matter, glides along
The surface, scarcely touching where it moves;
So here, from heel to point, glided the flames.

"Master! say who is he, than all the rest
Glancing in fiercer agony, on whom
A ruddier flame doth prey?"  I thus inquir'd.

"If thou be willing," he replied, "that I
Carry thee down, where least the slope bank falls,
He of himself shall tell thee and his wrongs."

>And now as glimm'ring dawn appear'd, that breaks
>More welcome to the pilgrim still, as he
>Sojourns less distant on his homeward way,
>Darkness from all sides fled, and with it fled
>My slumber; whence I rose and saw my guide
>Already risen.  "That delicious fruit,
>Which through so many a branch the zealous care
>Of mortals roams in quest of, shall this day
>Appease thy hunger."  Such the words I heard
>From Virgil's lip; and never greeting heard
>So pleasant as the sounds.  Within me straight
>Desire so grew upon desire to mount,
>Thenceforward at each step I felt the wings
>Increasing for my flight.  When we had run
>O'er all the ladder to its topmost round,
>As there we stood, on me the Mantuan fix'd
>His eyes, and thus he spake: "Both fires, my son,
>The temporal and eternal, thou hast seen,
>And art arriv'd, where of itself my ken
>No further reaches.  I with skill and art
>Thus far have drawn thee.  Now thy pleasure take
>For guide.  Thou hast o'ercome the steeper way,
>O'ercome the straighter.  Lo! the sun, that darts
>His beam upon thy forehead! lo! the herb,
>The arboreta and flowers, which of itself
>This land pours forth profuse!  Will those bright eyes
>With gladness come, which, weeping, made me haste
>To succour thee, thou mayst or seat thee down,
>Or wander where thou wilt.  Expect no more
>Sanction of warning voice or sign from me,
>Free of thy own arbitrement to choose,
>Discreet, judicious.  To distrust thy sense
>Were henceforth error.  I invest thee then
>With crown and mitre, sovereign o'er thyself."
