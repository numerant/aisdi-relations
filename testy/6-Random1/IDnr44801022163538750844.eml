These words it added: "Wherefore tear'st me thus?
Is there no touch of mercy in thy breast?
Men once were we, that now are rooted here.
Thy hand might well have spar'd us, had we been
The souls of serpents."  As a brand yet green,
That burning at one end from the' other sends
A groaning sound, and hisses with the wind
That forces out its way, so burst at once,
Forth from the broken splinter words and blood.

I, letting fall the bough, remain'd as one
Assail'd by terror, and the sage replied:
"If he, O injur'd spirit! could have believ'd
What he hath seen but in my verse describ'd,
He never against thee had stretch'd his hand.
But I, because the thing surpass'd belief,
Prompted him to this deed, which even now
Myself I rue.  But tell me, who thou wast;
That, for this wrong to do thee some amends,
In the upper world (for thither to return
Is granted him) thy fame he may revive."

"That pleasant word of thine," the trunk replied
"Hath so inveigled me, that I from speech
Cannot refrain, wherein if I indulge
A little longer, in the snare detain'd,
Count it not grievous.  I it was, who held
Both keys to Frederick's heart, and turn'd the wards,
Opening and shutting, with a skill so sweet,
That besides me, into his inmost breast
Scarce any other could admittance find.
The faith I bore to my high charge was such,
It cost me the life-blood that warm'd my veins.
The harlot, who ne'er turn'd her gloating eyes
From Caesar's household, common vice and pest
Of courts, 'gainst me inflam'd the minds of all;
And to Augustus they so spread the flame,
That my glad honours chang'd to bitter woes.
My soul, disdainful and disgusted, sought
Refuge in death from scorn, and I became,
Just as I was, unjust toward myself.
By the new roots, which fix this stem, I swear,
That never faith I broke to my liege lord,
Who merited such honour; and of you,
If any to the world indeed return,
Clear he from wrong my memory, that lies
Yet prostrate under envy's cruel blow."

First somewhat pausing, till the mournful words
Were ended, then to me the bard began:

>And now as glimm'ring dawn appear'd, that breaks
>More welcome to the pilgrim still, as he
>Sojourns less distant on his homeward way,
>Darkness from all sides fled, and with it fled
>My slumber; whence I rose and saw my guide
>Already risen.  "That delicious fruit,
>Which through so many a branch the zealous care
>Of mortals roams in quest of, shall this day
>Appease thy hunger."  Such the words I heard
>From Virgil's lip; and never greeting heard
>So pleasant as the sounds.  Within me straight
>Desire so grew upon desire to mount,
>Thenceforward at each step I felt the wings
>Increasing for my flight.  When we had run
>O'er all the ladder to its topmost round,
>As there we stood, on me the Mantuan fix'd
>His eyes, and thus he spake: "Both fires, my son,
>The temporal and eternal, thou hast seen,
>And art arriv'd, where of itself my ken
>No further reaches.  I with skill and art
>Thus far have drawn thee.  Now thy pleasure take
>For guide.  Thou hast o'ercome the steeper way,
>O'ercome the straighter.  Lo! the sun, that darts
>His beam upon thy forehead! lo! the herb,
>The arboreta and flowers, which of itself
>This land pours forth profuse!  Will those bright eyes
>With gladness come, which, weeping, made me haste
>To succour thee, thou mayst or seat thee down,
>Or wander where thou wilt.  Expect no more
>Sanction of warning voice or sign from me,
>Free of thy own arbitrement to choose,
>Discreet, judicious.  To distrust thy sense
>Were henceforth error.  I invest thee then
>With crown and mitre, sovereign o'er thyself."

>Through that celestial forest, whose thick shade
