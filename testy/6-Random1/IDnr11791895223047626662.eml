Thy judgment, that the human nature ne'er
Was or can be, such as in them it was.

"Did I advance no further than this point,
'How then had he no peer?'  thou might'st reply.
But, that what now appears not, may appear
Right plainly, ponder, who he was, and what
(When he was bidden 'Ask' ), the motive sway'd
To his requesting.  I have spoken thus,
That thou mayst see, he was a king, who ask'd
For wisdom, to the end he might be king
Sufficient: not the number to search out
Of the celestial movers; or to know,
If necessary with contingent e'er
Have made necessity; or whether that
Be granted, that first motion is; or if
Of the mid circle can, by art, be made
Triangle with each corner, blunt or sharp.

"Whence, noting that, which I have said, and this,
Thou kingly prudence and that ken mayst learn,
At which the dart of my intention aims.
And, marking clearly, that I told thee, 'Risen,'
Thou shalt discern it only hath respect
To kings, of whom are many, and the good
Are rare.  With this distinction take my words;
And they may well consist with that which thou
Of the first human father dost believe,
And of our well-beloved.  And let this
Henceforth be led unto thy feet, to make
Thee slow in motion, as a weary man,
Both to the 'yea' and to the 'nay' thou seest not.
For he among the fools is down full low,
Whose affirmation, or denial, is
Without distinction, in each case alike
Since it befalls, that in most instances
Current opinion leads to false: and then
Affection bends the judgment to her ply.

"Much more than vainly doth he loose from shore,
Since he returns not such as he set forth,
Who fishes for the truth and wanteth skill.
And open proofs of this unto the world
Have been afforded in Parmenides,
Melissus, Bryso, and the crowd beside,
Who journey'd on, and knew not whither: so did
Sabellius, Arius, and the other fools,
Who, like to scymitars, reflected back
The scripture-image, by distortion marr'd.


>Shot sudden through me.  Each thing else, the more
>Its love had late beguil'd me, now the more
>I Was loathsome.  On my heart so keenly smote
>The bitter consciousness, that on the ground
>O'erpower'd I fell: and what my state was then,
>She knows who was the cause.  When now my strength
>Flow'd back, returning outward from the heart,
>The lady, whom alone I first had seen,
>I found above me.  "Loose me not," she cried:
>"Loose not thy hold;" and lo! had dragg'd me high
>As to my neck into the stream, while she,
>Still as she drew me after, swept along,
>Swift as a shuttle, bounding o'er the wave.

>The blessed shore approaching then was heard
>So sweetly, "Tu asperges me," that I
>May not remember, much less tell the sound.
>The beauteous dame, her arms expanding, clasp'd
>My temples, and immerg'd me, where 't was fit
>The wave should drench me: and thence raising up,
>Within the fourfold dance of lovely nymphs
>Presented me so lav'd, and with their arm
>They each did cover me.  "Here are we nymphs,
>And in the heav'n are stars.  Or ever earth
>Was visited of Beatrice, we
>Appointed for her handmaids, tended on her.
>We to her eyes will lead thee; but the light
>Of gladness that is in them, well to scan,
>Those yonder three, of deeper ken than ours,
>Thy sight shall quicken."  Thus began their song;
>And then they led me to the Gryphon's breast,
>While, turn'd toward us, Beatrice stood.
>"Spare not thy vision.  We have stationed thee
>Before the emeralds, whence love erewhile
>Hath drawn his weapons on thee."  As they spake,
>A thousand fervent wishes riveted
>Mine eyes upon her beaming eyes, that stood
>Still fix'd toward the Gryphon motionless.
>As the sun strikes a mirror, even thus
>Within those orbs the twofold being, shone,
>For ever varying, in one figure now
>Reflected, now in other.  Reader! muse
>How wond'rous in my sight it seem'd to mark
>A thing, albeit steadfast in itself,
>Yet in its imag'd semblance mutable.

>Full of amaze, and joyous, while my soul
>Fed on the viand, whereof still desire
>Grows with satiety, the other three
>With gesture, that declar'd a loftier line,
