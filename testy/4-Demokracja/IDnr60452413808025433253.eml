The tears down-streaming roll'd.  Against a rock
I leant and wept, so that my guide exclaim'd:

When she is dead.  What guilt exceedeth his,
Who with Heaven's judgment in his passion strives?

Before whose eyes earth gap'd in Thebes, when all
Cried out, 'Amphiaraus, whither rushest?
'Why leavest thou the war?'  He not the less
