So shouted his fierce lips, which sweeter hymns
Became not; and my guide address'd him thus:

"O senseless spirit! let thy horn for thee
Interpret: therewith vent thy rage, if rage
Or other passion wring thee.  Search thy neck,
There shalt thou find the belt that binds it on.
Wild spirit! lo, upon thy mighty breast
Where hangs the baldrick!"  Then to me he spake:
"He doth accuse himself.  Nimrod is this,

>A man I knew him choleric and bloody."
>
>The sinner heard and feign'd not, but towards me
>His mind directing and his face, wherein
>Was dismal shame depictur'd, thus he spake:
>"It grieves me more to have been caught by thee
>In this sad plight, which thou beholdest, than
>When I was taken from the other life.
>I have no power permitted to deny
>What thou inquirest.  I am doom'd thus low
