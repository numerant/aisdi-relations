CANTO XXVII

Then  "Glory to the Father, to the Son,
And to the Holy Spirit," rang aloud
Throughout all Paradise, that with the song
My spirit reel'd, so passing sweet the strain:
And what I saw was equal ecstasy;

>Briareus: cumb'ring earth he lay through dint
>Of mortal ice-stroke.  The Thymbraean god
>With Mars, I saw, and Pallas, round their sire,
>Arm'd still, and gazing on the giant's limbs
>Strewn o'er th' ethereal field.  Nimrod I saw:
>At foot of the stupendous work he stood,
>As if bewilder'd, looking on the crowd
>Leagued in his proud attempt on Sennaar's plain.
>
>O Niobe! in what a trance of woe
