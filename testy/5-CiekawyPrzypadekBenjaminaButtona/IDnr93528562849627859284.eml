Harm thee, for power in him, be sure, is none
To hinder down this rock thy safe descent."

Prey, and consume thee!  Through the dark profound
Not without cause he passes.  So 't is will'd

>All sorrow from thy soul; and if again
>Chance bring thee, where like conference is held,
>Think I am ever at thy side.  To hear
>Such wrangling is a joy for vulgar minds."
