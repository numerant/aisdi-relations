I wept not: so all stone I felt within.
They wept: and one, my little Anslem, cried:
"Thou lookest so!  Father what ails thee?"  Yet
I shed no tear, nor answer'd all that day
Nor the next night, until another sun

And in four countenances I descry'd
The image of my own, on either hand
Through agony I bit, and they who thought
