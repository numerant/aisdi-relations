Me boldness thus to speak: 'Master, my Sight
Gathers so lively virtue from thy beams,
That all, thy words convey, distinct is seen.
Wherefore I pray thee, father, whom this heart
Holds dearest! thou wouldst deign by proof t' unfold

All good deeds and their opposite.'"  He then:

Directed, and thou plainly shalt behold
How much those blind have err'd, who make themselves
