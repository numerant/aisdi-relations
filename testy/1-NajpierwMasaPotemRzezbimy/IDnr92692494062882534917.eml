Since thou arrived'st at the mountain's foot,
Over the distant waves?"--"O!" answer'd I,
"Through the sad seats of woe this morn I came,
And still in my first life, thus journeying on,
The other strive to gain."  Soon as they heard

Was seated, crying: "Conrad! up with speed:
Come, see what of his grace high God hath will'd."
