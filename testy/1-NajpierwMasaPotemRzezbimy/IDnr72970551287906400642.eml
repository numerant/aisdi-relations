The fame, that honours your illustrious house,
Proclaims the nobles and proclaims the land;
So that he knows it who was never there.
I swear to you, so may my upward route
Prosper! your honour'd nation not impairs

That while the world is twisted from his course
By a bad head, she only walks aright,
And has the evil way in scorn."  He then:
