Beneath its guidance, in their prime of days
Scipio and Pompey triumph'd; and that hill,
Under whose summit thou didst see the light,
Rued its stern bearing.  After, near the hour,
When heav'n was minded that o'er all the world

Saw Loire and Seine, and every vale, that fills
The torrent Rhone.  What after that it wrought,
