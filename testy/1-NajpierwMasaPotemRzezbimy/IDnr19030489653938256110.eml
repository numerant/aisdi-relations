And diving back, a living topaz each,
With all this laughter on its bloomy shores,
Are but a preface, shadowy of the truth
They emblem: not that, in themselves, the things
Are crude; but on thy part is the defect,
For that thy views not yet aspire so high."

Rush, with such eager straining, to the milk,
As I toward the water, bending me,
To make the better mirrors of mine eyes
