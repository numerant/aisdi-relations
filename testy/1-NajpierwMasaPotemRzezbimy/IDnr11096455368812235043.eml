Pasiphae enter'd, that the beast she woo'd
Might rush unto her luxury."  Then as cranes,
That part towards the Riphaean mountains fly,
Part towards the Lybic sands, these to avoid

One crowd, advances th' other; and resume
Their first song weeping, and their several shout.

Who had erewhile besought me, and their looks
