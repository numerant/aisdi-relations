Who, for my safety, hast not scorn'd, in hell
To leave the traces of thy footsteps mark'd!
For all mine eyes have seen, I, to thy power
And goodness, virtue owe and grace.  Of slave,

For my deliverance apt, hast left untried.

Is loosen'd from this body, it may find
Favour with thee."  So I my suit preferr'd:
