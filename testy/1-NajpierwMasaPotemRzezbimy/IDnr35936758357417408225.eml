Thou shalt discern it only hath respect
To kings, of whom are many, and the good
Are rare.  With this distinction take my words;
And they may well consist with that which thou
Of the first human father dost believe,
And of our well-beloved.  And let this

Both to the 'yea' and to the 'nay' thou seest not.
For he among the fools is down full low,
