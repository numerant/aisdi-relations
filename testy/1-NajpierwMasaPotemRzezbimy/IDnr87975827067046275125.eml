The stragglers wander, so much mole they come
Home to the sheep-fold, destitute of milk.
There are of them, in truth, who fear their harm,
And to the shepherd cleave; but these so few,
A little stuff may furnish out their cloaks.

To mind, thy wish may be in part fulfill'd:
For thou wilt see the point from whence they split,
