Hath taken; whence I wand'ring by the shore
Where Tyber's wave grows salt, of him gain'd kind
Admittance, at that river's mouth, tow'rd which
His wings are pointed, for there always throng
All such as not to Archeron descend."

Memory and use of that sweet song of love,
That while all my cares had power to 'swage;
Please thee with it a little to console
