Behind, that profits not himself, but makes
His followers wise, when thou exclaimedst, 'Lo!
A renovated world!  Justice return'd!
Times of primeval innocence restor'd!
And a new race descended from above!'

With livelier colouring.  Soon o'er all the world,
By messengers from heav'n, the true belief
