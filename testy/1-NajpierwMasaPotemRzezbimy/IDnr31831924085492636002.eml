Besides, when I this point concluded thus,
By praying no defect could be supplied;
Because the pray'r had none access to God.

Contented unless she assure thee so,
Who betwixt truth and mind infuses light.
I know not if thou take me right; I mean
Beatrice.  Her thou shalt behold above,
Upon this mountain's crown, fair seat of joy."
