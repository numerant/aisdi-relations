Which gave me sov'reignty over the land
By Danube wash'd, whenas he strays beyond
The limits of his German shores.  The realm,
Where, on the gulf by stormy Eurus lash'd,
Betwixt Pelorus and Pachynian heights,

To have its scepter wielded by a race
Of monarchs, sprung through me from Charles and Rodolph;
