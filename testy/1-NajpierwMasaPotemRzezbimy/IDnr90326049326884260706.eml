Such scantiness of knowledge our delight:
For all our good is in that primal good
Concentrate, and God's will and ours are one."

And, as one handling skillfully the harp,
Attendant on some skilful songster's voice
Bids the chords vibrate, and therein the song
Acquires more pleasure; so, the whilst it spake,
