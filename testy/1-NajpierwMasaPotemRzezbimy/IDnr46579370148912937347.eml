Came from its lip, and in so soft a strain,
That all my sense in ravishment was lost.
And the rest after, softly and devout,
Follow'd through all the hymn, with upward gaze
Directed to the bright supernal wheels.

For of so subtle texture is this veil,
That thou with ease mayst pass it through unmark'd.
