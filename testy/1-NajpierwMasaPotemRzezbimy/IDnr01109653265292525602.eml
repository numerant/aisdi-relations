He needs must forfeit his nobility,
No longer stainless.  Sin alone is that,
Which doth disfranchise him, and make unlike
To the chief good; for that its light in him
Is darken'd.  And to dignity thus lost

Trangress'd, from these distinctions fell, no less
Than from its state in Paradise; nor means
