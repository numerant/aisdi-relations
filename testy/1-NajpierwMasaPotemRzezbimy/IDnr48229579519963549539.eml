"Is Provenzano.  He is here, because
He reach'd, with grasp presumptuous, at the sway
Of all Sienna.  Thus he still hath gone,
Thus goeth never-resting, since he died.

Who, beyond measure, dar'd on earth."  I then:

Repentance, linger in that lower space,
Nor hither mount, unless good prayers befriend,
