Which deaf before it, so that from afar
I spy'd the trembling of the ocean stream.

We travers'd the deserted plain, as one
Who, wander'd from his track, thinks every step
Trodden in vain till he regain the path.

Strove with the sun, and in a place, where fresh
The wind breath'd o'er it, while it slowly dried;
