If rarity were of that dusk the cause,
Which thou inquirest, either in some part
That planet must throughout be void, nor fed

Must in its volume change the leaves.  The first,
If it were true, had through the sun's eclipse
Been manifested, by transparency
Of light, as through aught rare beside effus'd.
