If he in love, in hope, and in belief,
Be steadfast, is not hid from thee: for thou
Hast there thy ken, where all things are beheld
In liveliest portraiture.  But since true faith
Has peopled this fair realm with citizens,

Thou in his audience shouldst thereof discourse."

And speaks not, till the master have propos'd
