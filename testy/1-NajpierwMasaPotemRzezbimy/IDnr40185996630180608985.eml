"Marcia so pleasing in my sight was found,"
He then to him rejoin'd, "while I was there,
That all she ask'd me I was fain to grant.
Now that beyond the' accursed stream she dwells,

Which was ordain'd me, when I issued thence.

Moves and directs thee; then no flattery needs.
Enough for me that in her name thou ask.
