What fate unto the mouse and frog befell.
For language hath not sounds more like in sense,
Than are these chances, if the origin
And end of each be heedfully compar'd.

Which added doubly to my former fear.

So foil'd, with loss and mock'ry so complete,
As needs must sting them sore.  If anger then
