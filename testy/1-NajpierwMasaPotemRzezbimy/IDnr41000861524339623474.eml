Of body ill compact, and worse in mind,
And born in evil, he hath set in place
Of its true pastor."  Whether more he spake,
Or here was mute, I know not: he had sped
E'en now so far beyond us.  Yet thus much
I heard, and in rememb'rance treasur'd it.

Cried, "Hither turn.  Lo! two with sharp remorse
Chiding their sin!"  In rear of all the troop
