Or from the waters (which, wherever heat
Attracts them, follow), might ascend thus far
To vex man's peaceful state, this mountain rose
So high toward the heav'n, nor fears the rage

With its first impulse circles still, unless
Aught interpose to cheek or thwart its course;
Upon the summit, which on every side
