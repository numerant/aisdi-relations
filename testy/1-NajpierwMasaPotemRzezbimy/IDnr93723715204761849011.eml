I not the less still on my way proceed,
Discoursing with Brunetto, and inquire
Who are most known and chief among his tribe.

"To know of some is well;" thus he replied,
"But of the rest silence may best beseem.

In brief I tell thee, that all these were clerks,
Men of great learning and no less renown,
By one same sin polluted in the world.
